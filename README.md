## Why I Built ReelVault  

I’ve always wanted a way to **save Facebook posts and Instagram reels** while scrolling.  
Sometimes I come across something funny, inspiring, or useful — and I think:  
*“I’ll come back to this later.”*  

But the problem? I usually forget. Saving within the apps is messy and unorganized.  

So I decided: **why not make my own system?**  

That’s how ReelVault was born — a place where I can:  
- Save reels I enjoy or want to reference later  
- Organize them into collections  
- Add notes and tags for context  
- Search and filter easily  
- Build a personal library I can always return to
