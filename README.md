# ReelVault

ReelVault is a project I built from a personal need.  
While scrolling through Instagram or Facebook, I often find reels or posts that are funny, inspiring, or useful. I usually want to save them to revisit later â€” but the built-in save features feel messy and unorganized.  

So I thought: *why not build my own system?*  

ReelVault lets me:  
- Save reels I enjoy or want to return to  
- Organize them into collections  
- Add notes and tags for context  
- Search and filter to find them quickly
