# ReelVault

ReelVault is a project I built from a personal need.  
While scrolling through Instagram or Facebook, I often find reels or posts that are funny, inspiring, or useful. I usually want to save them to revisit later â€” but the built-in save features feel messy and unorganized and i cant search.

So I thought: _why not build my own system?_

ReelVault lets me:

- Save reels I enjoy or want to return to
- Organize them into collections
- Add notes and tags for context
- Search and filter to find them quickly
- Auth system because why not
- It's scalable so i can always update and upgrade it
